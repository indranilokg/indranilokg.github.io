title: Step-up Authentication
---

Step-up authentication shows up frequently in digital applications, but is often implemented in an adhoc way by application developers or vendors.

I recently created an article attempting to examine  in detail the scenarios when applications need to step up authentication, and standardized ways to implement the behavior. Checkout the article in [Okta Developers blog](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2023/03/08/step-up-auth).
